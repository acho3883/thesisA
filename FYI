WEEK 5: C_COLLABORATIONS

It is possible that there was no unified project workspace for idea collaboration.
People can upload different topics (idea/discussion) from different collaboration labels (ideazone/project workspace).
2016-2017 are mainly Project Workshop, then Ideazone. There was a Knowledge Bank but probably doesn't exist anymore.
Meaning of experience_id unknown.
