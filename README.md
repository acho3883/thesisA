Meeting 1   15/03/2017
1. What is your company's strategy, goals, budget, and target customers?
2. What do you expect to learn from the data? What are your needs? How will you apply my reports?
3. What are the purposes in designing Meatball? What can it do? How does it work? What are its limitations?
4. Do I need to analyse how well Meatball works?
5. How was the data collected? Rate it across a scale? Objective or subjective question?
6. What meetings were recorded? Did everyone in the meeting participate (aka host and customers)? Were they recorded in all/most meetings of the same type?
7. Is the data from SQL database? Are they clean/no repetitions? How do you remove unclean data? What are they?
8. What is its capacity? How frequent are data collected? Still on-going?
9. How can I access the data for research purposes?
10. Are there any specific ways on how I need to present my data?

// Descriptive Analytics, which use data aggregation and data mining to provide insight into the past and answer: “What has happened?”
// Predictive Analytics, which use statistical models and forecasts techniques to understand the future and answer: “What could happen?”
// Prescriptive Analytics, which use optimization and simulation algorithms to advice on possible outcomes and answer: “What should we do?”
