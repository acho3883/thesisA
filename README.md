Meeting 1   15/03/2017

I was assigned to analyse data under one of the Intersective's programs, NEXT. Their interns did simple data analysis on data for other learning programs. Notified Phil to send us previous findings. Data has been collected since recently and nothing much have been found. I am registered into NEXT and is to explore NEXT in this coming week. Primary task would be to find out what the data could mean. Data sanitisation is still on-going, predicted to be done by next meeting. Data size is less than 2000. Many different types of data are being captured including chat.

Meatball is still under testing. Phil and Nikki might show me meatball next week. It is a more specialised version of Practera, catering to students from different universities with different requirements. Secondary task would be to find out if real life meeting updates are feasible.

Next meeting is scheduled to be either on 22/03/17 or 23/03/17.
